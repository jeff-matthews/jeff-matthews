As a career technical writing professional, I thrive on building documentation programs from the ground upâ€”especially when theyâ€™re rooted in a docs-as-code philosophy. I get excited by integrating documentation seamlessly into the development lifecycle, treating it with the same rigor, tooling, and collaboration as code. This approach not only enhances accuracy and consistency but also empowers engineers and writers to work together in a shared ecosystem.

Iâ€™m passionate about establishing scalable, maintainable documentation systems that are version-controlled, automated, and CI/CD-friendly. From selecting the right static site generators and content frameworks to defining contribution models and review workflows, I enjoy architecting every layer of the documentation stack. My goal is to create a culture where documentation is not an afterthought, but a first-class citizen in the product development process.

Leading these initiatives means mentoring writers, collaborating cross-functionally, and championing developer and user-centric content strategies. I find satisfaction in transforming fragmented and outdated documentation into a modern, user-friendly experience that drives product adoption and reduces support overhead.
